## About Me

I am Gadha Krishna Leons, a researcher deeply interested in the molecular mechanisms of hematological malignancies—especially B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL). As a final year PhD student, I’ve been working at the intersection of genomics, bioinformatics, and translational cancer research.

Currently, my work focuses on:
- Leveraging RNA-Seq and ML-based classifiers for subtype classification in B-ALL.
- Studying the role of genomic alterations (e.g., **CDKN2A/B deletions**) and their transcriptional consequences.
- Integrating multi-omics data to stratify patients and identify potential therapeutic targets.

When I’m not working with data or cells, I enjoy writing, reading (poems and fiction), and dabble in random hobbies like crochet.
